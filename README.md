# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System  

A machine learning powered web app that suggests movies based on your favorite picks. The system uses content-based filtering with cosine similarity and enriches the experience by fetching movie posters from TMDb API. Built with Python, Dash, and Jupyter Notebooks, it’s designed to be both educational and fun to use.
